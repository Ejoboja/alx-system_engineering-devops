Web Infrastructure Design
Introduction
This project focuses on designing various web infrastructures, covering concepts such as DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. It aims to enhance understanding of these concepts and their practical implementation.

Tasks Overview
Task 0: Simple Web Stack
Design a basic web infrastructure using a single server with a LAMP stack, hosting a website reachable via www.foobar.com.

Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure
Design a more complex infrastructure with three servers, including a load balancer, for hosting www.foobar.com.

Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
Enhance the previous infrastructure with security measures, encrypted traffic, and monitoring capabilities.

Task 3: Scale Up
Further scale the infrastructure by splitting components (web server, application server, database) onto separate servers.

Requirements
Each task requires whiteboarding the infrastructure design.
A README.md file is mandatory for each task.
After completing each task, provide a screenshot of the whiteboard design and upload it to a chosen image hosting service.
Ensure the project is written in English.
Conclusion
By completing these tasks, participants will gain practical experience in designing, securing, and scaling web infrastructures, thereby enhancing their knowledge and skills in web infrastructure design.
